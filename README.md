# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

I looked though the code and and the testing files to get a general understanding of what is going on in the project. From there I ran rspec on all the spec files and found all the errors in the code. I made note of these and their location and went from there.

What was hard about working with code you did not write?

Trying to understand what is going on. Mainly with the "require 'date'" because I wasn't sure what that even was.

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

What made it fairly easy was the fact that I can look at this now that I have more experience and be able to tell what the person who wrote this was trying to do.
